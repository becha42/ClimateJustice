# "Little Green Qubits" -> "QUBITS FOR THE CHILDREN" 

Results of the Quantum Internet Hackathon 2022! https://github.com/becha42/ClimateJustice/blob/main/ReportHackathon2022.md 

 This was a "challenge" / project proposal at the Quantum Internet Hackathon 2022:
 * https://labs.ripe.net/author/karla-white/take-part-in-the-quantum-internet-hackathon-2022/
 * Part of https://github.com/Lizaterdag/QIH-2022/ || https://github.com/Lizaterdag/QIH-2022/blob/main/README.md   

 This is a theoretical / conceptual challenge, trying to answer questions: 
 * Can Quantum Internet be environmentally sustainable? 
 * How can Quantum Internet contribute to Climate Justice?

 IMHO, quantum computing requires even more energy for cooling than regular computers; and the “traditional” Internet is already struggling with goals to decrease environmental impact. When combined, my fear is that Quantum Internet will be even more damaging for the climate. We are still in the early days of developing this new technology, so we can try to consider Climate Justice principles already.

 * https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/learning-reflections/intersections-of-digital-rights-and-environmental-and-climate-justice/ 

 Potential outcomes of this project can be:
 * an academic paper
 * a blog post or an article 
 * document with recommendations for building protocols 
 * a position paper 
 * IETF / IRTF draft 

 Events where we can continue working on this: 
 * IAB workshop: https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/e-impact/
 * Next IETF meeting(s)
 * RIPE86, May 2023
